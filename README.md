# My Portfolio

## Description
- For this task, I have created a new portfolio for myself, from scratch. Though it isnt much to look at now, I will continue to update it and make it look better each time! Within the site you while find a small bio about myself, the few projects that I have worked on in the program, and then links to my social media where I can be contacted.
## Finished Products!
